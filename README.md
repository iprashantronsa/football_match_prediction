This project aims to predict the outcome of football matches using historical match data and various machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through the process of loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset includes information on various football matches, including details like date, time, competition, venue, result, goals scored, and more.
Objective: The goal is to predict whether a team will win, lose, or draw a match based on historical data.
Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends.
Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Machine Learning models to predict match outcomes.
Libraries and Tools
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Key Sections
Data Loading: Loading and previewing the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to understand key trends and insights.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Building: Training and evaluating various machine learning models.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the outcomes of new matches.
